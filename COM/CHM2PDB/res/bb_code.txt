Let me present to you a small program that i have made..

After searching through the net for a reader for CHM files, i was frustrated.  :confused:  
So i have compiled a program that will [B]convert your CHM files to iSilo PDB[/B], so that they can be easily read with iSilo PDB reader!

The [B]user interface[/B] is very simple, infact you just have to point towards the source file and the destination folder!!  :cool: 

Any suggestions / comments are welcome.  :)
